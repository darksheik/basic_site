Since the meatiest portion of Michael Hartl's RailsTutorial.org is setting up the security, sign in/sign out functionality, and update capabilities for users, I'm keeping this repository up as a foundation for building a new site without having to plow through all of that again.

This enables you to hit the deck running with your apps functionality and rest assured that the user portion is taken care of.
